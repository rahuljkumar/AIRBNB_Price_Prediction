Aribnb price prediction

This Machine Learning project aims to predict Airbnb prices based on inputs such as Location of Airbnb, Number of rooms, Property type, Reviews in the Airbnb platform, etc.

I have performed EDA over the dataset. I have used multiple machine learning algorithms for training and have chosen the CatBoostClassifier model as the best model since it has given an Adjusted R2 score of 0.76. 

The entire notebook can be accessed from Dataset_and_Modeling -> EDA and Modeling.ipynb file.
